# Factor-Selection

This repository contains Python code to compute the optimal number of factors for large datasets according to different factor selection criteria. Thus far, the repository includes criteria from the following papers:

- Ahn, S.C. and Horenstein, A.R. (2013), Eigenvalue Ratio Test for the Number of Factors. Econometrica, 81: 1203-1227. https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA8968
  - Growth Ratio Criterion (function: AH_crit_GR)
  - Eigenvalue Ratio Criterion (function: AH_crit_ER)
